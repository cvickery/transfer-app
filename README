https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/runtime gives info on configuring gunicorn
through a configuration file (gunicorn.conf.py). This can be useful if you need access to the
client's IP address or to know whether the request was made through https or not. (HTTPS requests
become http requests when they go through gunicorn.)

Trying to figure out what url rules get specified in app.yaml and what ones in main.py using flask.

Pure static pages don't work. Need to work with Flask, which can do both static (templated if you
want them so) and app code, which I will need for authentication anyway.
Flask is based on the WSGI interface. Gunicorn is the server on app engine; Werkzeug is the server
when testing locally(?)

Trying to get back to this...
Starting with pure static pages ...

I copied the files from ../python-docs-samples/appengine/flexible/hello_world/ but haven't set up
the virtual environment yet.

Do I need the main_test.py file?
Can I get this thing to deploy and do authentication?
I want to set up static pages for index.html, prototype.js, and prototype.css
