# Transfer App

This is a web application for reviewing course transfer rules at the City University of New York (CUNY). The project is a Flask application, and uses a Postgres database backend. At the time of writing, it is deployed to the Google Application Environment, but it does not use any Google APIs.

The Postgres database is managed in the [cuny-courses](https://github.com/cvickery/cuny-courses/) project. <hr/>
