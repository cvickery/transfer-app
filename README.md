# Transfer App

This is a web application for reviewing course transfer rules at the City University of New York
(CUNY). The project is a Flask application, which uses a Postgres database. At the time of writing,
it is deployed to the Google Application Environment, but it does not use any Google APIs.

The Postgres database is managed in the [cuny-courses](https://github.com/cvickery/cuny-courses/) project.
