    <h1>CUNY Transfer Application</h1>
    <p>
      There are over a million<sup>&dagger;</sup> rules that tell how courses transfer among CUNY
      colleges. This site lets you see what rules exist (or not), to provide feedback about existing
      rules, and to track the status of the rule review process.
    </p>
    <p>
      The functions are designed so you can select just those colleges, departments, or courses you
      are interested in.

        Find which colleges a course or set of courses transfers to or from. Results are presented
        in tabular form with cells highlighted to identify possible problems.

        Display a complete list of all the courses for any CUNY College in standard college-bulletin
        format. But you have to say “Please,” and then be prepared for a “firehose” stream of
        information about thousands of courses. The mass of output has been known to drown some
        mobile browsers.

        This is a maintenance utility that shows reviews that have been submitted but not yet
        confirmed by the submitter. These reviews are purged if not confirmed within two days of
        submission.
